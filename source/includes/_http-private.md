# Private HTTP API Methods

The private HTTP API allows read / write access to your private account.

<aside class="notice">
Private HTTP URL: `https://poloniex.com/tradingApi`
</aside>

All calls to the trading API are sent via HTTP using POST parameters to https://poloniex.com/tradingApi and must contain the following headers:

* _Key_ - Your API key.
* _Sign_ - The query's POST data signed by your key's "secret" according to the HMAC-SHA512 method.

Additionally, all queries must include a "nonce" POST parameter. The nonce parameter is an integer which must always be greater than the previous nonce used and does not need to increase by one. Using the epoch in milliseconds is an easy choice here but be careful about time synchronization if using the same API key across multiple servers.

All responses from the trading API are in JSON format. In the event of an error, the response will always be of the following format:

`{ "error": "<error message>" }`

There are several methods accepted by the trading API, each of which is specified by the "command" POST parameter:

## returnBalances

```shell
# Note: set the nonce to the current milliseconds. For example: date +%s00000
echo -n "command=returnBalances&nonce=154264078495300" | \
openssl sha512 -hmac $API_SECRET

curl -X POST \
     -d "command=returnBalances&nonce=154264078495300" \
     -H "Key: 7BCLAZQZ-HKLK9K6U-3MP1RNV9-2LS1L33J" \
     -H "Sign: 2a7849ecf...ae71161c8e9a364e21d9de9" \
     https://poloniex.com/tradingApi
```

> Example output:

```json
{ '1CR': '0.00000000',
  ABY: '0.00000000',
  AC: '0.00000000',
...
  YIN: '0.00000000',
  ZEC: '0.02380926',
  ZRX: '0.00000000' }
```

Returns all of your balances available for trade after having deducted all open orders.

## returnCompleteBalances

Returns all of your deposit addresses.

Some currencies use a common deposit address for everyone on the exchange and designate the account for which this payment is destined by including a payment ID field. In these cases, use `returnCurrencies` to look up the `mainAccount` for the currency to find the deposit address and use the address returned here in the payment ID field. Note: `returnCurrencies` will only include a `mainAccount` property for currencies which require a payment ID.

## generateNewAddress

```shell
# Note: set the nonce to the current milliseconds. For example: date +%s00000
echo -n "command=generateNewAddress&nonce=154264078495300" | \
openssl sha512 -hmac $API_SECRET

> Example output:

```json
{ success: 1,
  response: '0xa6f0dacc33c7f63e137e0106ed71cc20b4b931af' }
```

Some currencies use a common deposit address for everyone on the exchange and designate the account for which this payment is destined by including a payment ID field. In these cases, use `returnCurrencies` to look up the `mainAccount` for the currency to find the deposit address and use the address returned here in the payment ID field.

```

Returns the status of a given order, specified by the "orderNumber" POST parameter. If the specified orderNumber is not open, or it is not yours, you will receive an error.

Note that returnOrderStatus, in concert with returnOrderTrades, can be used to determine various status information about an order:

* If returnOrderStatus returns status: "Open", the order is fully open.
* If returnOrderStatus returns status: "Partially filled", the order is partially filled, and returnOrderTrades may be used to find the list of those fills.
* If returnOrderStatus returns an error and returnOrderTrades returns an error, then the order was cancelled before it was filled.
* If returnOrderStatus returns an error and returnOrderTrades returns a list of trades, then the order had fills and is no longer open (due to being completely filled, or partially filled and then cancelled).

### Input Fields

Field | Description
------|------------
orderNumber | The identifier of the order to return.

### Output Field

Field | Description
------|------------
status | Designates this order's fill state.
